# iMacLinuxFanSpeed
*A tiny script that controls the fan speed of an iMac under Linux.*

## What?
This script automatically controls the fan speed of an iMac running Linux. It is written entirely in bash, and makes use of no external tools, just plain interaction with text files. It has a few parameters to start with, but feel free to tweak the code to suit your needs. This is very useful when using an iMac with a swapped hard drive, since Apple uses a proprietary temperature sensor that doesn't recognize the temperature sensor of regular drives, and therefore spins up the fans to full speed.
